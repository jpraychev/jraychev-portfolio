    "about" : "I am a software engineer and enthusiast working on multiple areas like computer networking, software engineering, python programming, web development and much more. It all started back in 2006 at high school. I was fascinated with computers and I really wanted to know how do they work. I am curious by nature and always wonder how something work and that probably drew my into IT fields. In 2010 I went to university to study Telecommunications and start a career as a network administrator. Few years later in 2015 I graduated with honors and went straight into the wild to work as a IT field engineer. An year later I applied for a PhD and in 2019 I defend my thesis successfully. Since then I kinda switched fields and started working more as a software developer, freelancer and writer. I mainly write about software on my blog and all articles are published to Medium. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to send me email at jpraychev@gmail.com or use the contact page.",
